# FunLabyrinthe in Scala

This is a reimplementation in Scala of my long-lived project
[FunLabyrinthe](http://www.funlabyrinthe.com/). The aim of this
reimplementation is to make it more portable, especially in three areas:

*   Executable on Linux and Mac OS, in addition to Windows
*   Make the runner executable on mobile devices
*   Maybe someday, with the help of
    [Scala-JS](https://github.com/lampepfl/scala-js.git), make the runner
    work on the browser, to allow people to give it a try live.

I do not expect this project to reach maturity before a long time. The
existing software can be used until then!
